<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### It's basically JUST A MONOREPO.

This project is the first e-commerce created by me. So i'm sorry if the code is "Amburadul" üòÇ.
Fyi i don't have an "IT Background", so this project was made just to proves that people like me can make a thing like this :)

### Built With

- pnpm
- Turborepo
- NextJS
- NestJS
- Prisma
- Supabase

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

One thing to note is that this stack is _kind of opinionated_, but you are completely free to tweak anything according to your needs and preferences. For example, this stack heavily depends on Supabase for auth and file storage, but you are still free to setup/build your preferred way of handling auth and storage.

The instructions below will mostly cover the default pre-configured frameworks and libraries I personally chose as the starting template of the V6 Stack.

### Prerequisites

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for supabase local development)

### Setup and installation

#### 1. Install packages

```sh
$ pnpm install
```

#### 2. Setup env files

Several `.env.template` files have been created for you. Create your own `.env` to be used in your project. Adjust the needed values accordingly.

#### 3. Initialize supabase

To develop using supabase locally, a supabase config is provided inside the `api` app. Navigate to the `api` folder and run

```sh
npx supabase start
```

to start your own local supabase instance through docker. Run

```sh
npx supabase stop
```

inside the `api` folder to shutdown the containers. For more guides and reference please refer to their [official docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development).

#### 4. Prisma Migrate

Create a Prisma migration to sync changes in your `schema.prisma` to your database. Navigate to the `db` package and run this command.

```sh
pnpm db:migrate
```

#### 5. Supabase Auth

If you're using supabase's auth service, chances are you also want to store your user's data inside your database's `public` schema. A minimal SQL function and trigger has been provided for you inside `packages/db/supabase/triggers` .

```sql
-- handle_new_users.sql
-- inserts a row into public."Profiles"
create function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer set search_path = public
as $$
begin
  insert into public."Profiles" (id, email, name)
  values (
    new.id,
    new.email,
    new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name');
  return new;
end;
$$;

-- trigger the function every time a user is created
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();

```

Run this query on your database to duplicate a user's data every time a user signs up using supabase auth.
